<h1>Browser Fingerprinting</h1>
<p1>A Browser Fingerprint is a unique ID which is generated to identify your specific computer from the millions of other computers and users out there. The internet, which comprises three main languages: HTML, CSS and javascript. While the former doesn't offer much information on the user and what he uses or what his general practices are on the internet. Javascript can get a lot of information about a user by having simple code in the website. Information which is very specific to the user. Among many functions javascript is capable of the most important include make and model of the laptop, default language, timezone, browser plugins, how active the user is on the browser etc. All of these functions often run when you are simply browsing on a website. All these little bits of information add up to build a user a virtual profile. The number of bits it tracks that uniquely identifies you doesn't change no matter what browser you are on, Private browsing or public browsing.  A way to keep all these websites from tracking bits of you is to blend into the general public. Not using specific browsers outside of google, mozilla, microsoft edge makes it easier to blend you into other users. Instead of finding bits that separate you. While in recent years companies are openly saying they are trying to step away from methods that track your movements on the web, browser fingerprinting is still a very renowned method among most websites out there.</p1>
