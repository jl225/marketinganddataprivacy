<h1>Becoming Anonymous: The Complete Guide To Maximum Security Online</h1>
<p1> The guide to security can be split up into three main zones: Easy basic privacy, More complex privacy, Drastic privacy and finally Extreme privacy. These names are arbitrary and given to show the extent of privacy in each “zone”.Easy basic privacy refers to items like passwords and answering security questions in ways that can never be guessed. The easiest way to be safe on the internet is having a strong password for each account and having a password manager. This password manager should also have a very strong password. While it is often overlooked, having a VPN is also very helpful in being safe on the internet. It keeps your identity hidden when browsing. Social media has basic rules when trying to be inside the first zone. However If a user is trying to achieve full security social media cannot be a part of their daily routine. Zone 2 refers to users who are trying to be a little bit more secure. For these users it is essential that communication is lockdown. Text messages should be avoided in most cases. If it is unavoidable you must use apps that keep it completely secure. Luckily imessage is very secure for IOS users. Otherwise apps like signal are key to staying secure. Like messaging there are alternative apps and programs that fully encrypt emails. While any web browsers were fine for the first stage. From the second stage on any chrome browsers are not safe for the purpose of staying safe. For the second “zone” and above firefox is the browser to use to be safe on the internet. In the next zone the main priority to be in drastic privacy is choosing a secure Operating system. The most secure and safe OS to use is Windows Host OS.  Along with the operating system if users want to be in this zone of security it is integral to keep away from google. The final zone of being secure on the internet includes steps like spoofing your MAC address, this address identifies the type of device you have and information about the device.
